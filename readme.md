## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/animepahe-api.git
cd animepahe-api
npm install
npx playwright install ## Install Playwright browsers (required for scraping and cookies auto-refresh)
copy .env.example .env  # On Windows
```

## Configuration

The API comes with sensible defaults and works out of the box without any configuration. However, you can customize its behavior by creating a `.env` file in the root directory with the following options:

```env
# Base configuration
PORT=3000                   # The port the API server will run on
BASE_URL=https://animepahe.ru
USER_AGENT= # eg: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (but Not required)

# Cookie configuration (Optional - see Cookie Management section below)
COOKIES=your_cookies_here   # Only set this if you want to override automatic cookie management

# Proxy configuration (Optional - for enhanced reliability)
USE_PROXY=false            # Set to 'true' to enable proxy support
PROXIES=http://proxy1.com,http://proxy2.com    # Comma-separated list of proxy servers
```

### Cookie Management

The API includes automatic cookie management that handles everything for you. You typically **do not need to set cookies manually**. Here's how it works:

1. The API automatically manages and refreshes cookies as needed
2. Cookies are stored in `data/cookies.json` and updated automatically
3. Manual cookie configuration via `COOKIES` env var is optional and only needed if you want to override the automatic management

If you do need to set cookies manually (not recommended), use this format in your `.env` file:
```
COOKIES=cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2
```

### Proxy Format
The `PROXIES` variable should be a comma-separated list of proxy URLs:
```
http://proxy1.com:8080,http://user:pass@proxy2.com:8080
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Unavailable (503)**
   - This usually means the API is having trouble accessing Animepahe
   - Solution: Wait a few minutes and try again, or enable proxy support if issues persist

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - The API includes built-in protection against rate limiting
   - If you still get rate limited, try:
     - Reducing your request frequency
     - Enabling proxy support
     - Waiting a few minutes before retrying

3. **Cookie-Related Issues**
   - By default, the API handles cookies automatically
   - If you see cookie-related errors:
     - Make sure the `data` directory exists and is writable
     - Don't set the `COOKIES` env var unless absolutely necessary
     - Try deleting `data/cookies.json` to let the API regenerate fresh cookies

4. **Proxy Support**
   - Only enable proxy support if you're experiencing consistent access issues
   - When enabling proxies, make sure to provide valid proxy URLs
   - Test your proxy URLs before adding them to the configuration
